# I'm a data engineer and analytics practitioner with a passion for solving complex problems end-to-end. From architecting pipelines to building ML systems, I love working at the intersection of structured data and unstructured challenges.

With a background that spans real-time processing, cloud-native workflows, and applied AI, I bring both precision and creativity to the table — whether it’s optimizing a dashboard or deploying a forecasting model.

Outside the world of SQL, Spark, and embeddings, I’m a curious traveler and unapologetic foodie. I believe great ideas (and great meals) often come from unexpected places.
